# The No Attribution" License

The "No Attribution" or "-0" license is a modification to the
usual MIT license that also removes the requirement for attribution. It is
roughly the same as an MIT license consisting of a sandwich of
(paragraph, line, paragraph), but it is missing the middle line of the
'sandwich'.

## Rationale

This license has proven useful for code that is intended for
developers to use as reference, teaching samples, examples, or
templates that other developers may modify for their own purposes.

In many of these cases, the initial developer may not want to impose
even the cost of attribution, or the use cases may not be conducive to
attribution.

The CC0 and various "do what you want" licenses and various public
domain dedications may be less attractive to the initial developer for
various reasons (i.e., a license is preferable to a public domain
dedication).  The MIT license with all the attribution requirement
language removed fills this need.
