# The "Widely-Sourced" License

A "Bare-License" & not a contract agreement.





## Rationale

See debate regarding diffrences between a "Bare-License" & Contract Agreements. 

 
 CC0 and various "do what you want" licenses and various public
domain dedications may be less attractive to the initial developer for
various reasons (i.e., a license is preferable to a public domain
dedication).  The MIT-0 license's with all the attribution requirement
language removed is one response to this. 

## Potential License Draft: (Based on Fair License)
 
Usage of the work(s)/resources without warranty is permitted provided that this license instrument is retained with the works, or if you may, that any entity that uses the works is otherwise notified of the instruments.

formulation and publication of a license-instrument with a similar nature.
